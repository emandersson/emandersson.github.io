Abstract</h4></center>
This project is about automatic mapping of irregular so called adventure
type pools. It is a part of a larger project driven by the assigner, Weda,
to develop a pool-cleaner robot for these kinds of pools. The robot shall
be developed from the current line of pool-cleaners made for rectangular
pools. Especially the robot shall be adapted to the B400 model which is
the most widely sold pool-cleaner. The assigners project has been tending
towards using map based positioning as a navigation method of the pool-cleaner.
<p>The mapping algorithm uses a sonar sensor to make local map patches
around the pool-cleaner, after which it makes use of a matching algorithm
for matching map patches to each other. As the pool-cleaner is exploring
the pool, local maps are obtained and then matched and merged to the current
map so that eventually a global map is obtained. The exploring of the pool,
i.e. deciding where the next scanning pose shall be, is done manually.
<p>The sonar transducer is mounted on a stepper motor to be able to rotate
one revolution and thereby make a polar local map-patch. The sonar is a
standard recreational boat sonar, which has been modified by the manufacturer
to fit this project. The mapping algorithm has been tested with good results
in the pool at Weda and in a larger adventure pool in Fyrishov, Uppsala.
